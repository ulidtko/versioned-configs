This is a repository in which max ulidtko stores some of his config files. He
finds DVCS very convenient for doing this: one can have backup and easy
replication and synchronisation of configuration files between several machines
literally for free.


Structure of the repo
=====================
.
|-- HOME
|   |-- bash_profile
|   |-- bashrc
|   |-- gitconfig
|   |-- inputrc
|   |-- profile
|   |-- ...
|   |-- vimrc
|   `-- zshrc
`-- README

Surprisingly enough, HOME denotes your home directory. Files under HOME are hard
links[1] to real config files (I guess symbolic links are usable too, but
personally I use the hard ones), with leading dots in their names removed. So as
your config files change, `git status`, `git diff` and others reflect these
changes, and vice versa: `git pull` from another machine will update your config
files directly, with neat merging, changes history etc etc. Cool huh?

The single limitation of hard links is that they have to be on the same FS as
your home. My recommendation for placing the repo is ~/.config/versioned

Using
=====
Some basic knowledge of git is inherently needed for working with this.

Procedure is simple: clone the repo, setup the links, and you are done.

$ cd ~/.config
$ git clone git://github.com/ulidtko/versioned-configs.git versioned
or
$ git clone ssh://ulidtko.homelinux.net/~/.config/versioned
$ cd versioned
$ less README  #  ;-)
$ rm -i ~/.profile; ln HOME/profile ~/.profile
$ rm -i ~/.vimrc; ln HOME/vimrc ~/.vimrc
and so on.
