This is a repository in which max ulidtko stores some of his config files. He
finds DVCS very convenient for doing this: one can have backup and easy
replication and synchronisation of configuration files between several machines
literally for free.


Structure of the repo
=====================
.
|-- HOME
|   |-- bash_profile
|   |-- bashrc
|   |-- gitconfig
|   |-- inputrc
|   |-- profile
|   |-- ...
|   |-- vimrc
|   `-- zshrc
|-- install.sh
`-- README

Surprisingly enough, HOME denotes your home directory. Files under HOME are
config files with leading dots in their names removed. To use them, you'll need
to replace your current config files under ~ with symlinks. install.sh will
help you do that.

I'd be glad to know how to make git rewrite files instead of replacing them
when manipulating the working copy. This way it could be possible to use hard
links instead of replacing files in ~ with symlinks; if you know relevant git
option, tell me.


Using
=====
Some basic knowledge of git is inherently needed for working with this.

Procedure is simple: clone the repo, setup the links, and you are done.

$ cd ~/.config
$ git clone git://github.com/ulidtko/versioned-configs.git versioned
or
$ git clone ssh://ulidtko.homelinux.net/~/.config/versioned
$ cd versioned
$ less README  #  ;-)
$ ./install.sh
