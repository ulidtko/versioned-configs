# FIXME still dubious of this as a global default...
# I know, I'm supposed to commit lockfiles. And bun's binary lockfile is nice,
# just minimally obnoxious, short in diffs, doesn't make me scroll through kilo-lines
# of json diff -- like yarn, npm, pnpm do. Still, I don't like every commit which
# moves dependencies checks-in a source of rebase conflicts in binary file. Yuck.
