## Pathogen submodules YESSS ##

Dear "vim bundle manager" authors, can I have a freaking
**changelog viewer** in your shiny creations?..

* @shougo dein - awesome UI! But no changelog view.
* @junegunn vim-plug - single-file install, great (I don't really care).
  No changelog view.
* @gmarik vundle - Has changelog! But undermaintained:
  43 standing PRs & 2 commits the whole last year (2018). Damn it.

Also a bunch of others; unremarkable. This is like the 3ʳᵈ time in years
I'm wasting half a day re-evaluating the Vim bundle management zoo.

Every time I stay on Pathogen no problem.

'Cause you see, `git submodule update --init` ain't that hard!  
`git submodule update --remote --recursive -- bundle/vim-airline` ain't that hard!
Just read the man or something, or google it, I dunno `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

... And voila I have `git log` for my changelog for free! All is great.

Those smartasses calling vim submodules stupid? No U R stupid!
I have clickable stuff on GitHub and free changelog feature -- eat that, bitch!
